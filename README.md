# Newbot

A 300% original discord.js bot, this time written using discord.js commando!

Has music playing commands and other stuff

TTS and sing commands can be found at https://github.com/Awedtan/TTSbot

Disclaimer: I've modified my version of discord.js commando to stop the bot from constantly pinging people. If something doesn't work properly let me know
